Overview:

The project leverages banking data analytics and machine learning to inform banking decisions. By analyzing data from 41,188 bank customers, the study aims to understand the impression factors that drive customers' transaction decisions and guide their subsequent work.

Purpose and objectives: The purpose is to discover the factors that drive the transaction, the most weighted factors, and to make the bank's work more targeted. The goal is to save work costs and improve work efficiency for bank staff by maximizing pre-screening of customers.

Novelty: This study introduces bank resource analysis and machine learning, especially the random forest algorithm, to analyze transaction results. It highlights the importance of understanding bank customer behavior and guiding organizational decision-making.

Methods: This study uses Kaggle's data set and uses the random forest algorithm for analysis. Statistical and graphical representations aid data interpretation and reveal the weight of different factors on deal outcomes. At the same time, KNN, SVM, logistic regression, and decision tree models are used to compare the accuracy.

Research results: The analysis found that the top three most influential floating factors in the transaction results are: euribor 3m, nr.employed, emp. var. rate. And there is a positive correlation. The higher the value, the more willing bank customers are to make transactions.
